    <p class="centre" style="padding-top: 100px;">Welcome to my website, where I share my thoughts and opinions on three movies that I really like.
        These movies are Inception, Unbreakable, and Interstellar. They are all masterpieces of storytelling and
        filmmaking, and they have different themes and genres. Inception is a mind-bending thriller that explores the
        world of dreams and the power of the subconscious. Unbreakable is a realistic and psychological drama that
        examines the concept of superheroes and villains. Interstellar is a sci-fi epic that investigates the scientific
        and philosophical aspects of space travel and time dilation. These movies are not only entertaining, but also
        inspiring and thought-provoking. I hope you enjoy reading my reviews and analyses of them.</p>
